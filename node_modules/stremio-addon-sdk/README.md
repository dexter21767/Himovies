# Stremio Add-on SDK ðŸ§™

![Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/website/stremio-purple-small.png)

The **ðŸ§™  Stremio Add-on SDK ðŸ§™** was developed by the Stremio Team as a way of vastly simplifying Node.js add-on creation for
our streaming platform.

Stremio currently supports Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS.


## Quick Example

This arbitrary example creates an add-on that provides a stream for Big Buck Bunny and outputs a HTTP address where you can access it.

```javascript
const { addonBuilder, serveHTTP, publishToCentral }  = require('stremio-addon-sdk')

const builder = new addonBuilder({
    id: 'org.myexampleaddon',
    version: '1.0.0',

    name: 'simple example',

    // Properties that determine when Stremio picks this add-on
    // this means your add-on will be used for streams of the type movie
    catalogs: [],
    resources: ['stream'],
    types: ['movie'],
    idPrefixes: ['tt']
})

// takes function(args, cb)
builder.defineStreamHandler(function(args, cb) {
    if (args.type === 'movie' && args.id === 'tt1254207') {
        // serve one stream to big buck bunny
        const stream = { url: 'http://distribution.bbb3d.renderfarming.net/video/mp4/bbb_sunflower_1080p_30fps_normal.mp4' }
        return Promise.resolve({ streams: [stream] })
    } else {
        // otherwise return no streams
        return Promise.resolve({ streams: [] })
    }
})

serveHTTP(builder.getInterface(), { port: 7000 })
//publishToCentral("https://your-domain/manifest.json") // <- invoke this if you want to publish your add-on and it's accessible publically on "your-domain"
```

Save this as `addon.js` and run:

```bash
npm install stremio-addon-sdk
node ./addon.js
```

It will output a URL that you can use to [install the add-on in Stremio](./docs/testing.md#how-to-install-add-on-in-stremio)

**Please note:** add-on URLs in Stremio must be loaded with HTTPS (except `127.0.0.1`) and must support CORS! CORS support is handled automatically by the SDK, but if you're trying to load your add-on remotely (not from `127.0.0.1`), you need to support HTTPS.


## Getting started with a new add-on

In order to scaffold a new Stremio add-on, we've made a tool called `addon-bootstrap`.

You can use it in the following way:

```bash
npm install -g stremio-addon-sdk # use sudo if on Linux
addon-bootstrap hello-world
```

You'll be asked about what [resources and types](./docs/api/README.md) you want to support, after which the add-on will be created in the `hello-world` directory, and you'll be able to run it:

```bash
cd hello-world
npm install
npm start -- --launch
```

If you wish to install the add-on in the Desktop version of Stremio (which you can [download here](https://www.stremio.com/downloads)), you should use `npm start -- --install`

## Documentation

All our documentation is [right here on GitHub](./docs). Take a look at our [examples list](./docs/examples.md) for some high-level
information, or dive straight into our [SDK documentation](./docs/README.md) for our code reference docs.

We also have an [example add-on](https://github.com/Stremio/addon-helloworld) that you can use as a guide to help you build your own add-on.

We've made two step by step guides: one for this SDK, and one for any programming language, [which you can read here](https://stremio.github.io/stremio-addon-guide).

If you don't wish to use Node.js (and therefore not use this SDK either), you can create add-ons in any programming
language, see the [add-on protocol specification](./docs/protocol.md) for more information.

It is also possible to create an add-on without any programming language, see our [static add-on example](https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-static-addon-example) based
on the protocol specification.

SDK Features Include:

- Publishing an add-on through HTTP(s)
- Publishing an add-on through IPFS
- Publishing your add-on link to the [public Add-on collection](https://api.strem.io/addonscollection.json) with [publishToCentral](./docs/README.md#publishtocentralurl)
- Creating a homepage for your add-on that includes an "Install Add-on" button

## Testing

For developers looking for a quick way to test their new add-ons, you can either:

- [Test with Stremio](./docs/testing.md#testing-in-stremio-app)
- [Test with our Web Version](./docs/testing.md#testing-in-stremio-web-version)


## Deploying

In order for your add-on to be used by others, it needs to be deployed online.

You can check our [list of recommended hosting providers for Node.js](./docs/deploying.md) or alternatively host it locally with [localtunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel).

After you've deployed publically, in order to get your add-on to show in Stremio (through the [public Add-on collection](https://api.strem.io/addonscollection.json)), you need to use [publishToCentral](./docs/README.md#publishtocentralurl).


## Examples & tutorials

Check out our ever growing list of [examples and demo add-ons](./docs/examples/README.md). This list also includes examples & tutorials on how to develop Stremio addons in PHP, Python, Ruby, C#, Java and Go. It also includes a list of video tutorials.


## Advanced Usage

Read our [guide for advanced usage](./docs/advanced.md) to understand the many ways that add-ons can be used.


## Reporting Issues

If you have any issues regarding the Stremio Add-on SDK, please feel free to [report them here](https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-addon-sdk/issues).


## Migration from v0.x

To migrate from v0.x, you need to:

- change `new addonSDK` to `new addonBuilder`, which you can import via `const addonBuilder = require('stremio-addon-sdk').addonBuilder`
- change `addon.run(opts)` to `serveHTTP(addon.getInterface(), opts)`, which you can import via `const serveHTTP = require('stremio-addon-sdk').serveHTTP`
- all handlers have to return a `Promise` (rather than take a `cb`)


## Use Cases Outside Add-on SDK

The use of this SDK is not mandatory for creating Stremio Add-ons. You can use any programming language that supports
creating a HTTP server to make Stremio Add-ons. Refer to our [protocol specification](./docs/protocol.md) for details and examples.

One useful scenario of not using the SDK is when you need user specific data for you add-on (for example, an API
Autherntication Token), you can see an example of passing user specific data in the Add-on URL [here](./docs/advanced.md#using-user-data-in-add-ons).
This example uses Node.js and Express to get user specific data.
